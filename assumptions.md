Assumptions:

1. Assume that there are no identical users, channels in the data store  

2. The authUserId that is generated by authRegister is both an ownerMember and in allMembers 

3. There wonâ€™t be any removal of existing users. (This will impact the generating of authUserId) 

4. Created a handle generator as per instructions although found no use of it in iteration 1, so it is assumed that it will be used in later iterations. 

5. When channelsCreate returns a set of parameters for a new channel, it passes an authUserId through both ownerMembers and allMembers. (different authUserIds would be generated for both parameters based on authRegisters) 

6. An Integer would be passed through channelId rather than a string. If the channel returned is the first channel created, the authUserId would be 0, and if it is the second channel returned, the authUserId would be 1.
